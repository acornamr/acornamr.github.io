# Dashboard Use Cases

The dashboard is designed to allow the consolidation of ACORN data into an .acorn file and its exploration. A user with credentials to access ressources for a site could (1) combine clinical and lab data into an .acorn file; (2) save a generated .acorn file in the cloud; (3) load an existing .acorn file and explore the data it contains.

The four use cases below cover the most anticipated uses of the dashboard.

## (A) Upload a .acorn

1. Open the dashboard (either online or standalone app)
2. Click on "upload a local acorn file"
3. Click on "Load .acorn" and select a local acorn file.
4. Explore the data
5. Exit the dashboard

## (B) Generate a .acorn

1. Open the dashboard (either online or standalone app)
2. Log in with an account for an existing site
